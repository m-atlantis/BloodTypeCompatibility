# Instructions
To run the tests do:

```python test_homomorphic.py```

## Choice of subset S
I have chosen to create the subset using no duplications, and choosing randomly from the set of y's. 
The number of elements chosen is 2 - n. The reason I always choose 2 is such that the noise will be bigger in the resulting encryption.
