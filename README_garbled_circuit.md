# Instructions
To run the code, type
```python test_garbed_circuit.py```

Both OT with ElGamal encryption and the Garbled Circuit works correctly now.
I didn't quite understand the problem with not using depth as input parameter to the hash? 
Is it to avoid creating a hashing using the values that would match, without knowing at which depth this happened, like you would add a persons IDs to a hash for Homomoprhic Encryption of electronic votes?
