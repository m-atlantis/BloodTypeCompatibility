## Instructions
Type `python test.py` to run the program.

You will be prompted to type in the blood type for the recipient and donor. 
The allowed values for these are either their respective name or the bit encoding of the blood type, e.g.:
    
    AB+
    AB-
    B+ 
    O+
    O-
    111
    101
    001
    010
    ... etc.

Once both have been input, the program will return the result as a single bit, 1 for compatible, 0 for non-compatible.
